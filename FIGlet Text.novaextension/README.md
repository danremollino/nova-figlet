# Requirements

## FIGlet
FIGlet Text requires [FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org) to be installed locally. It is recommended to install FIGlet using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh). Once Homebrew is installed, simply run `brew install figlet`.
## Monospaced Fonts
It is recommended to only use a monospaced font in Nova. Not doing so will result in garbled looking FIGlet conversions.

# How to Use FIGlet Text
FIGlet Text will add a 'Create FIGlet Text from Selection' menu item to the Editor menu. Make one or more selections in the editor and run the command.

# TODO
- option to auto comment converted text
